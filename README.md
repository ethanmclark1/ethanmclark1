# Join Me on My Journey of Open-Source AI Research!

Hi there, I'm Ethan Clark üëã  
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an enthusiastic individual eager to delve into AI research within the open-source community.  
My aim is to collaborate with like-minded individuals and make valuable contributions to projects that promote positive change and benefit society as a whole.

### About Me
üî≠ Currently, I'm a graduate student in the [Cooperative Robotic Systems lab](https://www.public.asu.edu/~yzhan442/CRS.html) at Arizona State University, where I'm focused on developing cooperative multi-agent systems.  
üå± I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of AI. Some topics that I'm currently exploring include offline reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and generative AI (of course).  
üìö I'm also an avid reader and always on the lookout for new book recommendations. Ask me about my recent favorite book or suggest one that you've enjoyed!  
üçÑ In addition to AI and reading, I'm also interested in bonsai and mushroom cultivating.  
üí¨ Ask me anything about AI! I love to chat the philosophical or the theoretical!  

### Skills and Tools
